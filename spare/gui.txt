want:

board on the left side of the screen, 8x8 grid of buttons?



menu to the right: choose either randomwalk, inputwalk, or completewalk

user should be able to step through walk

for randomwalk:
user inputs start square, then we run randomwalk()
show the resulting path as a string:
1. xx
2. xx
so on

to the right
below the board, buttons stepforward and stepbackward


for inputwalk:
user selects number of squares and starting square, then
one by one inputs the squares in the walk.


for completewalk:
user inputs start square

run the alg, show result as in randomwalk


--------------------------------------------

how to update the board:
no updates while the algs are generating paths, that will
only update board.squares

so need a method maybe that takes in the resulting path and
a move to go to, and it prints the board after that number of moves

then the moves shown in the menu
1. xx
2. xx
so on

could actually be buttons that you click to go to that move

also given that we're on move i, the buttons stepforward and 
stepbackward should call the function with move i+1 and i-1.
